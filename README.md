# Volume Boost Extension

Minimal browser extension skeleton for boosting the active tab's audio.

## Load in Chrome/Edge
1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable "Developer mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder.

## Notes
- This is a basic starting point. Some sites may block or restrict audio processing.
- We can expand scope later (AI-based leveling, noise reduction, per-site settings, etc.).
